How it will works this file is for handling voices I/O of our Model :) 

Explaining Functions :-

1) Listen = This is a Function Which is Totally for Speech Recognition with vosk for offline and free of cost :)

2) Tell = This is a function with pyttsx3 for shorts warning telling (For Different voice)

3) speak = This is the function by with our model with mainly speak

def listen(language : str = "en") -> str:
    """

    A voice management System for Speech Recognition With vosk in en, en-in and hindi also, and you can modify
    this for any other language by downloading other language package at vosk official site

    Link = (https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)

    by this link you will Download your language model

    NOTE = Download small Model bcz they take memory also and cause of memory leak there is no guarantee for that
